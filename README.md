# UnityLiveProject

# Introduction

During my time in the Game Developer Bootcamp at the Tech Academy, I was apart of two live projects. The first one being a 2-week sprint of creating a classic arcade game in Unity. In this live project I decided I wanted to remake Pac-Man. Being able to start from scratch and make changes based on how I would like my Pac-Man remake to look and feel. Before this live project I didn't have any experience with Unity or any form of game designing, but during this project I learned a lot about the process. I was able to start from scratch and use a combination of sprites with box colliders in combination of C# scripts.

I got a lot of experience in the live project that I will abe able to transfer into the job of my choice. I will be able to use the information I learned in this live project to create basic games and multiple genres. I took part in every daily standup and learned what the other students were doing. I was also able to ask questions whenever I needed and got quick help all the time. I learned that if I am stumped from something, to step back and take some time off, if this didn't work and I could still not find the solution, asking the instructors was the best things to do. This not only helped during the projects, but also taught me that asking for help is nothing bad, it only helps the team.
